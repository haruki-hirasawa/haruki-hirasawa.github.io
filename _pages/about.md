I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Department of Atmospheric and Climate Science at the University of Washington](https://atmos.uw.edu/) in Seattle, WA, USA. I am working in the [Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB) Project](https://atmos.uw.edu/faculty-and-research/marine-cloud-brightening-program/) lead by Professors Robert Wood and Sarah Doherty, researching the representation of MCB in global climate models and the potential climate impacts of MCB interventions. I received my PhD from the [Department of Physics at the University of Toronto](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/), where I worked under Professor Paul Kushner.

My research focuses on the interactions of [atmospheric aerosols](https://www.pnnl.gov/atmospheric-aerosols) - small, reflective particles in the atmosphere - and climate. This includes the impact of past inadvertent human emissions, changes in forest fire emissions, and of potential future deliberate sea salt aerosol emissions. I conduct my research primarily using global climate model simulations in the [Community Earth System Model](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/) and [Energy Exascale Earth System Model](https://e3sm.org/).

I was born in Tokyo, Japan and moved to Canada at an early age, eventually growing up in St. John's, Newfoundland whose climate gave me an appreciation of the interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, and ice in the North Atlantic and of a nice, snow-chilled beer. 

I currently serve as the Postdoc Trustee of [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Workers Local 4121](https://www.uaw4121.org/) and was previously Postdoc Recording Secretary. I also served as the President of the University of Toronto Graduate Environmental Student's Association.
